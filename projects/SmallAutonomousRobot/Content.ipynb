The purpose of this project was to provide an opportunity to apply all that we learned in CMPE‐118 to solve an open‐ended problem. The task was to build an autonomous robot capable to navigate the game field, locate and destroy the enemy ATM6’s (using ping pong ball ammo), and then shoot down Ren’s ship with a very well‐aimed shot."

The device must finish the task without any human interaction. This means the robot must use sensors and time to figure out its course of action.

When the rollers were  too low the wheels had not enough friction and slipped on the field. On the other hand when the ball rollers were to high, the robot rocked back and forward to much. The numerous adjustments that we had to perform to the rollers proved the useful of the modular design as we only had to disassemble the bottom layer and work on it separately, leaving the other layers intact."

The framework is also flexible enough to expand and create new events and event checkers. \n",

    "\n",
    "We successfully built a machine capable of finishing the task. The robot we built managed to complete the task under two minutes. Even though we designed our robot to be robust, there was still great variability in its performance. We partially attribute this variability to change battery levels, slipping/stalling of the wheels on the field  and our algorithm for line following. If we were to redo this project we would chose motors with more torque and an algorithm that follows the line more closely."
